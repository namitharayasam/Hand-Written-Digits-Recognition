# ✍️ Handwritten Digits Recognition using Deep Learning

This project is a **beginner-friendly** deep learning model that recognizes **handwritten digits (0-9)** from images using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**. It is trained on grayscale **28x28 pixel images** from datasets like **MNIST**.

## 📌 Features

- **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** for image classification.
- **Trained on 28x28 grayscale images** (single-channel).
- **Uses ReLU activation** for feature extraction and **sigmoid activation** for digit classification.
- **Optimized with Adam** for faster convergence.
- **Achieves high accuracy** on digit recognition tasks.
